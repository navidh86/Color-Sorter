# Color-Sorter
ATMega32 project on 3-1

The project was completed using an atmega32. We also needed a TCS3200 color sensor and two SG90 servo motors.
It can detect the color of an object (ping pong balls in this case) and place it in its designated container using the servo motors. 
The first servo places a ball under the sensor. After the color of the ball has been determined, the second servo orients a rail to the container
of that color. Then the first servo drops the ball on the rail and tha ball rolls into its designated container.
